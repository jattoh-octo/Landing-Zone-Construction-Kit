## Build Landing Zones easily

Use [Orbit](https://github.com/OCTOcloud/Orbit-cli) cli to easily work with the landing zone construction kit

```shell
# initialize a new Orbit repository
Orbit init

# add a cloud foundation connecting your platforms
Orbit foundation new "my-foundation"

# create a new kit module with an infrastructure as code template
Orbit kit new "aws/organization-policies"   

# apply the kit module to one of your cloud foundation's platforms
Orbit kit apply "aws/organization-policies"

# deploy all modules applied to the foundation to build your landing zone
Orbit foundation deploy "my-foundation" 
```
